00:01.580 --> 00:09.260
Now for our access policy in Exige role to be useful actually useful We're going to have to attach these

00:09.260 --> 00:11.080
resources together.

00:11.420 --> 00:15.000
And for this last part of I am operations.

00:15.020 --> 00:18.080
Let's just go up and create our method.

00:18.350 --> 00:29.110
So I'm going to say attach access policy to execution Rob.

00:29.240 --> 00:30.650
All right.

00:30.650 --> 00:41.840
So within this method what I'm going to do is read her I am client dot attach roll policy.

00:41.840 --> 00:49.820
So this is the method that I'm looking for and I have to pass in the roll name first and that is of

00:49.820 --> 00:58.040
course the Lamda role and to policy Aaron is of course the one that I have here.

00:58.070 --> 01:02.850
So let's just get it where the axis policy error.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.320
And here we go.

01:04.850 --> 01:10.030
So now let's go down and call our Methot and see it in action.

01:10.280 --> 01:15.710
So let's just say attach access policy to execution rule.

01:15.860 --> 01:21.780
I'm going to go and hit run.

01:22.010 --> 01:23.620
And here we go.

01:23.690 --> 01:33.110
Our request is successful with HTP through hundert and our access policy is attached to our execution

01:33.110 --> 01:33.550
roll.

01:33.560 --> 01:38.480
So we are ready to move on with creating our lambda function.

01:38.750 --> 01:42.090
So to do that I'll be seeing you on the next video.
