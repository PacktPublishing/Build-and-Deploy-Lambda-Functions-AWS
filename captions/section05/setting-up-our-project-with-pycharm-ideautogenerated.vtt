00:01.900 --> 00:06.630
Now let's go and create our project with my charm ID.

00:06.820 --> 00:14.590
So I already opened up my I.D. and I'm going to go and hit create new project and from there I'm going

00:14.590 --> 00:16.620
to select pure python.

00:16.690 --> 00:20.430
And after that I'm going to say Lamda

00:22.770 --> 00:24.330
underscore functions.

00:24.330 --> 00:25.320
All right.

00:25.410 --> 00:29.780
And for my interpreter I'm going to use the existing interpreter.

00:29.790 --> 00:30.560
All right.

00:30.780 --> 00:37.090
And then I'm going to go and simply hit create.

00:37.090 --> 00:38.150
There we go.

00:38.440 --> 00:42.630
We have our project created on PI charm ID.

00:42.640 --> 00:53.040
So let's go to our project main directory and from there from new Let's create a Python package and

00:53.080 --> 00:58.690
I'm going to name my package as SIRC and you can name yourself any way you like.

00:58.690 --> 01:01.570
So I'm going to go and hit enter.

01:01.720 --> 01:05.090
And here we go we have our SIRC package.

01:05.200 --> 01:12.820
And as you can see our initialiser is right there to indicate that this is a package from Python.

01:12.820 --> 01:20.340
So I'm going to right click on my SIRC directory and create a new python file.

01:20.710 --> 01:33.850
And for my python file I'm going to name it as lammed the functions.

01:33.950 --> 01:39.650
And here we go our land of functions that pi is ready.

01:39.650 --> 01:47.290
So now let's go and import both three so we can make use of the beauty of the library.

01:47.330 --> 01:50.340
So I'm going to say import both three.

01:50.540 --> 01:51.770
All right.

01:51.950 --> 01:59.210
And the very next thing that I'm going to do is of course create a client that we can make use of lambda

01:59.210 --> 02:00.210
functions.

02:00.290 --> 02:13.090
So I'm going to say def when the client and what I'm going to do is I'm going to get a reference to

02:13.090 --> 02:15.810
my client as a double use lambda.

02:16.270 --> 02:23.470
And from there I say both all three client and lambda.

02:23.470 --> 02:24.260
All right.

02:24.460 --> 02:34.920
For my region I'll say I'm going to use a region close to me so I'll say you west one.

02:34.930 --> 02:36.580
All right.

02:36.580 --> 02:43.750
And the next thing that I'm going to do is of course get the benefits of Pi both of three which is the

02:44.080 --> 02:47.180
autocomplete magic for PIJ Armande.

02:47.200 --> 02:55.240
So what I'll do is I'm going to put my combers there and from there I'll provide a type definition and

02:55.390 --> 03:04.300
let's say type in PI both of three dot lambda.

03:04.300 --> 03:05.610
All right.

03:05.900 --> 03:11.500
So the last thing that I have to do is of course return my Lamhe the client.

03:11.510 --> 03:15.110
So let's say return AWOS lambda.

03:15.140 --> 03:16.240
All right.

03:16.250 --> 03:19.730
So we're basically ready to move on with our project.

03:19.850 --> 03:22.400
So to do that I'll see you on the next video.
