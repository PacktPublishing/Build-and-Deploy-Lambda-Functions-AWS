Hi welcome to AWOS with Python and both are three developing lambda functions I'm desired on and I'm

00:11.490 --> 00:14.640
an AWOS certified solutions architect.

00:14.640 --> 00:20.370
And in this course our guide you through the process of developing and deploying lambda functions to

00:20.420 --> 00:30.450
AWOS using Python and both three and this course we're going to cover Java no js Python and how these

00:30.450 --> 00:37.950
lambda functions can be developed and deployed and packaged to J-ws so we can apply our code to run

00:37.950 --> 00:42.170
on the server list application framework of a deal with us.

00:42.240 --> 00:49.000
And as you know lambda is the leading So release function framework on the cloud environments.

00:49.170 --> 00:56.640
So to make use of this great framework and this great service from A W-S you need to know how you can

00:56.640 --> 01:00.190
create package and deploy these functions to the cloud.

01:00.450 --> 01:06.990
So in this girls all got you through the whole process from the very beginning to assigning policies

01:06.990 --> 01:10.380
to creating the actual functions.

01:10.440 --> 01:17.490
So by the end of this course you'll learn everything you need to develop and deploy your lambda functions.

01:17.650 --> 01:27.020
Iturbi and Java No just Python and much more so without further ado let's get started.
