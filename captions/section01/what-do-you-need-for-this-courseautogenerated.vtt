Before we get ready to implement our lambda functions.

00:06.170 --> 00:11.570
Let's take a look at what we're going to need throughout the course so that we can successfully follow

00:11.570 --> 00:17.600
along and you can do as I say to create your own functions.

00:17.650 --> 00:24.600
So when this occurs first and foremost is A W-S account so you don't need an AWOS account.

00:24.610 --> 00:27.180
And if you don't just don't worry about it.

00:27.340 --> 00:32.210
AWOS has a free tier available for like up to 1 year.

00:32.320 --> 00:39.550
And within this one year period you can definitely use lambda functions until a certain period of time

00:39.580 --> 00:43.300
and that is about a 1 million request per month.

00:43.300 --> 00:47.730
So that is a huge number and you can definitely want to check this out.

00:47.740 --> 00:54.910
And you just want to create an AWOS account and I highly encourage you to do that to create an account

00:55.150 --> 00:59.170
and I'll be showing you how to do that in the following lectures.

00:59.170 --> 01:04.120
So just bear with me and I'll explain you everything.

01:04.230 --> 01:11.060
It is not a precondition or not necessary but it is nice to know what a W is lammed those two are from

01:11.060 --> 01:12.310
A W-S.

01:12.630 --> 01:19.180
So as I said AWOS lambda is the surrealist application framework from AWOS.

01:19.260 --> 01:25.510
You can just upload your code you can get the proper permissions and there you go.

01:25.740 --> 01:30.330
That's all you have to do to have a working application on a W-S.

01:30.480 --> 01:36.900
You can just execute your functions depending on events or you can just trigger them by your hand or

01:37.110 --> 01:39.010
by an event.

01:39.030 --> 01:46.520
That's basically how AWOS lambda functions work and you can integrate AWOS lambda with most of the AWOS

01:46.530 --> 01:47.540
services.

01:47.580 --> 01:53.700
Don't worry about it I'll explain you everything you need to know about AWOS lambda and how you can

01:53.700 --> 02:01.970
make use of it using Python and both three and apart from that I'm expecting you to have a basic knowledge

02:02.000 --> 02:07.830
of python and apart from basic If your experience with it.

02:07.930 --> 02:13.840
That's just great because what we're willing to do is going to involve some Python understanding and

02:14.180 --> 02:16.240
Python data structures.

02:16.400 --> 02:23.690
It is not necessary to know everything about Python not even an intermediate level but it is nice if

02:23.690 --> 02:27.300
you have a basic understanding of the language.

02:27.500 --> 02:35.240
And of course to work with Python we're going to need a python ID that's going to help us to Intellisense

02:35.390 --> 02:42.040
and that's going to help us to complete our functions and we're going to highlight our syntax within

02:42.080 --> 02:44.600
ID so idea is important.

02:44.630 --> 02:51.620
And for that case I'm recommending you to get Pi charme ID from Jet brains and the best part of jet

02:51.620 --> 02:59.130
brains the best part of Pi charm ID is it has a free community edition that you can get to install without

02:59.130 --> 02:59.870
a charge.

02:59.900 --> 03:06.770
So if you don't have enough funding for that purpose you can just go and get the free community edition

03:06.770 --> 03:08.980
of Pi charme ID.

03:09.010 --> 03:16.390
So this is basically all you need to have to be successful in the scores and to set up our environment

03:16.450 --> 03:20.080
and follow along with creating our AWOS account.

03:20.260 --> 03:21.770
I'll be seeing you on the next section.
