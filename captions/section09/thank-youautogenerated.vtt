All right we come to an end of another great course on AWOS concepts and this time it was AWOS Lamda

00:09.740 --> 00:14.630
the surplus backbone of AWOS services and applications.

00:14.910 --> 00:21.480
So with AWOS Lamda as you could see with the examples and implementations that we did throughout the

00:21.480 --> 00:28.980
course you can basically implement your applications and basically functions with any language that

00:28.980 --> 00:31.600
you want using python.

00:31.640 --> 00:40.530
No Jesus or Java go dot net and some other applications under application programming languages.

00:40.740 --> 00:46.590
You can basically implement your logic and you can just package your application code and you can deploy

00:46.590 --> 00:52.750
it to AWOS lambda and you don't even have to manage any kind of infrastructure for your code.

00:52.770 --> 00:54.800
You don't have to manage the memory size.

00:54.870 --> 01:01.000
You don't have to manage the C.P. use or this size for application execution.

01:01.050 --> 01:07.290
All you have to do is provide your source code and AWOS lambda takes care of the rest.

01:07.290 --> 01:16.500
So AWOS Lumba again is a great service from AWOS and it is again the server is cornerstone for surreals

01:16.500 --> 01:25.540
application development on AWOS and I highly encourage you to use lambda functions for any kind of purposes

01:25.540 --> 01:27.160
that you can think of.

01:27.880 --> 01:35.110
So before I close up I'd like to give you a huge thank you for joining me on this course and I hope

01:35.110 --> 01:42.010
this was a great journey for you because it was for me and I hope to see you on my upcoming courses

01:42.010 --> 01:48.010
on a W-S and various other topics like Java spring and so on.

01:48.010 --> 01:50.290
So thank you so much again.

01:50.350 --> 01:53.300
And I'd like to see you on my upcoming courses.

01:53.380 --> 01:57.880
So have a great day and have a great journey on AWOS.
