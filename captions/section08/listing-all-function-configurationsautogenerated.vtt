Getting all the configurations of all your functions with A W-S is also very simple.

00:08.770 --> 00:12.330
And let's see how we can do that and to do that.

00:12.480 --> 00:24.290
I'm defining another method I'll say get all functions and I'm not going to pass in this time because

00:24.770 --> 00:28.970
all I have to do is get all the functions not a specific function.

00:28.970 --> 00:33.720
So I'll say and let's just fix that typo there.

00:33.910 --> 00:39.520
When the client and I'm going to call list functions.

00:39.620 --> 00:40.610
All right.

00:40.610 --> 00:41.980
That's all I have to do.

00:42.200 --> 00:51.530
So let's just go down and call this method with wrapped around as a print statement and I'll say get

00:51.590 --> 00:52.560
all functions.

00:52.560 --> 00:53.980
All right.

00:53.990 --> 00:59.260
So I'm just going to go and hit Grun.

00:59.470 --> 01:01.380
And here we go.

01:01.450 --> 01:08.650
And as you can see if we scroll down a little bit we have all of our functions on dirty functions indicator

01:08.680 --> 01:10.170
are key in this case.

01:10.300 --> 01:18.060
And within that array read how all of our functions we have as the first function our Java lambda function

01:19.390 --> 01:25.620
and then if we go and scroll down a little bit more we have our Python and the function.

01:25.630 --> 01:30.280
And if we scroll down a little bit we will see that we are No.

01:30.370 --> 01:32.820
Yes lambda function.

01:33.210 --> 01:39.850
So this is basically how you can get all the configurations of for all of your lambda functions on a

01:40.110 --> 01:43.950
US account and it is very straightforward as you can see.
