As with any other resources on AWOS you might have to delete your lambda functions and let's learn how

00:09.900 --> 00:12.830
we can do that and to do that.

00:13.100 --> 00:23.410
I'm just going to go up here and define my method and I'll say do eat Lamda

00:26.580 --> 00:27.690
function.

00:27.720 --> 00:28.500
All right.

00:28.680 --> 00:35.060
So I'll just pass in a function name so I can use it to delete my lambda function.

00:35.520 --> 00:43.000
And within my method I'm just going to say I'm the client that delete function.

00:43.180 --> 00:45.340
All right just like that.

00:45.600 --> 00:53.560
And I'm going to pass in the function name as my argument to this call.

00:53.700 --> 00:59.650
So let's just say function name equals to function name.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.070
All right.

01:01.190 --> 01:02.880
Let's just fix that typo.

01:04.120 --> 01:05.550
And here we go.

01:05.620 --> 01:14.530
So let's just go down and comment this line out first and let's just say do eat lambda function and

01:14.710 --> 01:18.420
this time I want to delete the no Chia's lambda function.

01:18.440 --> 01:19.070
All right.

01:20.460 --> 01:26.340
Now let's go and execute this method.

01:26.350 --> 01:27.340
Here we go.

01:27.790 --> 01:37.510
Let's switch back to our AWOS console and from there let's go to functions and as you can see we only

01:37.510 --> 01:42.320
have two functions and those are job Alamdar function in Python lambda function.

01:42.340 --> 01:45.820
We don't have any no Geass lambda function anymore.

01:46.090 --> 01:54.940
We successfully treated our No just lambda function and deleting your lambda functions is very straightforward.

01:54.970 --> 01:56.020
As you can see.
