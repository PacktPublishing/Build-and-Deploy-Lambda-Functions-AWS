As with any resource of AWOS lambda functions has basic operational functions that you can access the

00:09.860 --> 00:17.410
configuration of your function update your function update the configuration get all the functions that

00:17.410 --> 00:21.600
you have and delete them and so on.

00:21.610 --> 00:30.040
So to start off with getting a function configuration lets us implement our method to see all the configuration

00:30.040 --> 00:31.960
regarding a lambda function.

00:32.260 --> 00:42.900
So I'll say def get function and within this method all I want to pass in is a function name as I always

00:42.900 --> 00:43.600
do.

00:44.040 --> 00:54.130
So within this method all I want to do is return Lamda client and yet function.

00:54.820 --> 01:05.100
And within this method I want to pass in a function name and also function name and the parameter passing

01:05.100 --> 01:08.060
in from my method signature as you can see here.

01:08.340 --> 01:17.670
So if I go down and let's first comment these lines out and I basically print out the response for this

01:17.670 --> 01:25.480
get function call and I'm just going to go and pass in my Python lambda name.

01:25.570 --> 01:31.050
So let's just go and hit run and get the configuration of our lambda function.

01:33.240 --> 01:34.530
And here we go.

01:34.620 --> 01:42.780
Our request is successful and if we scroll down a little bit as you can see we have the configuration

01:42.780 --> 01:46.430
object under the configuration key within the dictionary.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.180
We have the function name as Python lambda function.

01:50.400 --> 01:57.530
We have the air end of the function as you can see here we have the runtime as Python 3.6.

01:57.600 --> 02:02.450
We have a roll handler and basically everything about glamour function.

02:02.610 --> 02:12.270
And even as you can see we have the last modified date we have called SSA 256 and so on.

02:12.270 --> 02:18.950
So this is basically how you can access the configuration the full configuration of your lambda function.
