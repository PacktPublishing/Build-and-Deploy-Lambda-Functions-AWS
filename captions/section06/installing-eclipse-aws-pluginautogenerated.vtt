00:02.120 --> 00:10.720
Until now we've learned how we could create implement and deploy no GIs and Python lambda functions.

00:11.140 --> 00:17.840
And now it's time to check out how we can do the same principles and apply the same principles to Java

00:17.840 --> 00:19.300
lambda functions.

00:19.460 --> 00:27.020
And I should note that the following three lectures are going to be all about Java lambda functions.

00:27.050 --> 00:34.160
So if you're not interested in Java lambda functions how to create how to deploy and how to implement

00:34.160 --> 00:42.050
them with A W-S lambda you can basically skip all three lectures and follow along with me on the other

00:42.050 --> 00:48.230
section where we're going to check out how we can version and how we can publish lambda functions.

00:48.260 --> 00:56.660
So if we're interested in how to deploy a WS lambda functions with the Jawa then please follow along

00:56.660 --> 00:57.720
with me.

00:57.740 --> 01:06.410
So in this lecture we're going to see how easy it is to create lambda functions with Eclipse the popular

01:06.830 --> 01:10.340
Java ID so forth eclipse.

01:10.460 --> 01:18.380
The best part of Eclipse is that AWOS has a plug in that you can install from the eclipse marketplace

01:18.680 --> 01:20.070
right into your ID.

01:20.140 --> 01:21.490
Your eclipse ID.

01:21.710 --> 01:26.620
So with this plug in it is super easy to create lambda functions.

01:26.630 --> 01:33.990
So now let's go to our eclipse and if we don't have it you can get it from Eclipse Foundation's Web

01:33.990 --> 01:34.250
site.

01:34.250 --> 01:35.790
It is very easy to do so.

01:35.900 --> 01:41.060
And I'll be providing a link so that you can get your Eclipse version for your computer.

01:41.120 --> 01:48.190
So I'm going to open up my Eclipse ID right now and I'll show you how you can get the AWOS plug in.

01:48.530 --> 01:57.380
So now I'm typing in Eclipse to my finder and I'm opening up my eclipse so I have basically the latest

01:57.380 --> 01:59.390
version as the time being.

01:59.480 --> 02:01.770
So it is loading up right now.

02:04.540 --> 02:05.370
All right.

02:05.530 --> 02:08.020
I have my Eclipse opened up.

02:08.020 --> 02:15.350
So the thing that I'm going to do to get the AWOS plug in for my Eclipse distribution.

02:15.550 --> 02:23.610
I'm just going to go down to help section and from there I'm going to go to eclipse marketplace and

02:23.820 --> 02:31.560
from the Marketplace on the find section and I'll have to wait for this window to load properly.

02:33.340 --> 02:34.330
And there we go.

02:34.480 --> 02:41.620
So I'm just going to type in a W-S just like that and I'm going to hit enter.

02:41.680 --> 02:46.580
So as you can see we have the AWOS took it for Eclipse 2.0.

02:46.630 --> 02:49.150
So I'm just going to go and hit install

02:53.110 --> 03:01.870
and it is now resolving the features and resolving all the dependencies regarding a W-S plugin for Eclipse.

03:01.960 --> 03:05.510
And I'm just going to fast forward this section.

03:05.600 --> 03:11.770
So now we have the necessary dependencies regarding a W-S toolkit for Eclipse.

03:11.900 --> 03:19.070
And as you can see from here you can do real stuff with a W-S toolkit using Eclipse and you can as you

03:19.070 --> 03:21.750
can see manage your RLDS instances.

03:21.800 --> 03:29.300
You can work with cloud formation code commit code deploy star elastic beanstalk and of course lambda

03:29.300 --> 03:31.640
functions and UPS works.

03:31.640 --> 03:35.240
So what we're interested in is of course the lambda functions.

03:35.270 --> 03:41.660
So I'm not going to check the rest of the toolkit plug ins and I'm just going to simply check out the

03:42.020 --> 03:47.780
lambda plugin and as you can see I have to install the core plug in for a W-S toolkit.

03:47.780 --> 03:55.080
So now I'm going to go and hit continue and it is now calculating the requirements and dependencies

03:55.470 --> 03:58.010
this is going to take some time and here we go.

03:58.140 --> 04:04.110
So I'm going to hit except the terms and license agreements and I'm going to go and hit finish.

04:04.110 --> 04:07.180
To complete my installation.

04:07.390 --> 04:08.520
And here we go.

04:08.680 --> 04:14.850
Our insulation is started and it is currently on around 7 percent.

04:14.860 --> 04:24.140
It is about to complete and now as you can see our changes are about to be applied and for doing that

04:24.170 --> 04:26.640
we're have to restart our ID.

04:26.660 --> 04:38.670
So I'm just going to hit restart now and our eclipse is being restored it and from my opening up screen

04:38.710 --> 04:44.040
as you can see are AWOS and Elvis collection window appeared.

04:44.110 --> 04:50.890
So you can either opt in or opt out of collecting anonymous usage data by A W-S.

04:50.890 --> 04:55.820
So in this case I'm just going to take this and hit finish.

04:55.890 --> 05:03.600
So now to verify that we have the AWOS plugin installed within our eclipse ID I'm going to go to files

05:03.600 --> 05:12.240
section and from there I'm going to try to create a new AWOS project and let's just go and hit other

05:12.870 --> 05:15.990
and from there let's just type in J-ws.

05:16.530 --> 05:22.800
And as you can see we have various options regarding lambda and the surrealists architectures so we

05:22.800 --> 05:28.630
could successfully install the AWOS toolkit within our eclipse ID.

05:28.890 --> 05:35.090
So in the next video we're going to go and create our We're first a we us Jawohl lambda function.

05:35.370 --> 05:36.780
So I'll see on the next video.
