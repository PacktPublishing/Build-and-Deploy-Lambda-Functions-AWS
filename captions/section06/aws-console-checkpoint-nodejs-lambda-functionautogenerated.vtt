So now I'm on my AWOS console and my Alamdar functions and I'm just going to go and refreshed to see

00:10.050 --> 00:13.060
my no just LAMDA.

00:13.270 --> 00:14.500
And there we go.

00:14.620 --> 00:17.240
We have our No just Lamda function.

00:17.410 --> 00:20.640
So let's just go ahead and check it out.

00:20.770 --> 00:28.870
And as you can see we have the proper execution roll access policy as we can see from S three and cloud

00:28.870 --> 00:30.050
watch logs.

00:30.520 --> 00:38.500
And if you go below with our function code we can definitely check out our source code from here.

00:38.500 --> 00:44.490
And as we can see with the runtime we have no J as a top 10 runtime.

00:44.860 --> 00:52.100
And we have the proper Flunder the function handler and we have the proper execution roll.

00:52.170 --> 00:55.770
We have the proper memory and timeout.

00:55.860 --> 01:01.140
So we basically have everything we need for our nodes as lambda.
