00:01.530 --> 00:09.680
So now I opened up my AWOS castle and if you don't already please open it up so we can follow along

00:10.080 --> 00:11.950
and check out our lambda function.

00:12.730 --> 00:22.210
And on from the search bar I'm just typing in Lamda and I'm just going to hit enter and from there I

00:22.210 --> 00:26.920
should see now my lambda function.

00:27.220 --> 00:28.860
And here we go.

00:29.110 --> 00:33.140
Our lambda function is created on a WS.

00:33.430 --> 00:42.040
And if I click on it to see it in detail I can see the configuration that I created for my lambda function.

00:42.040 --> 00:49.360
And as you can see the access permissions as we defined within our policy document is for cloud watch

00:49.360 --> 00:51.950
logs and S 3.

00:52.210 --> 01:01.600
And if we go down a little bit as you can see the code for our function is uploaded to AWOS properly

01:01.930 --> 01:09.590
as we defined within our source code and the run time is again Python 3.6.

01:09.730 --> 01:20.160
And our handler is Lamda underscore function dot handler and we have other variables that we defined

01:20.220 --> 01:22.980
and the ones that we don't define already.

01:23.130 --> 01:33.180
And we have 10 seconds as a timeout and we have 128 megabytes of memory for our land execution and our

01:33.360 --> 01:40.970
existing role is our will and the execution role as we create it before we create our lambda function.

01:41.400 --> 01:46.180
And now let's just check out how are when and the function performs.

01:46.320 --> 01:53.120
And for that purpose we're going to invoke our Alamdar function in our upcoming sections.

01:53.250 --> 02:00.420
We can definitely do that by hitting on test method test button right here but we're not going to do

02:00.420 --> 02:00.890
that.

02:00.900 --> 02:04.850
We're going to invoke RLM to function in our upcoming lectures.

02:04.860 --> 02:11.040
So for that purpose for creating are under lambda functions as being no.

02:11.100 --> 02:12.830
Yes and Java.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.810
I'll see on the next videos.
