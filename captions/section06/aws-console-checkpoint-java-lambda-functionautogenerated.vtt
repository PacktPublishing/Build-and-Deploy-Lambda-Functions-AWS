So I opened up my AWOS castle and from there if I go to functions under a AWOS Lamda and here we go

00:10.590 --> 00:13.300
we have our Java lambda function.

00:13.650 --> 00:16.840
And let's just go and check out the details.

00:17.190 --> 00:24.270
And as you can see we have the proper policies applied and we could access as three cloud watch loads

00:24.480 --> 00:27.000
from our Java lambda functions.

00:27.720 --> 00:31.100
And so our job file is uploaded.

00:31.200 --> 00:38.790
And as you can see it is indicating that we have our code our job package for our application for our

00:38.790 --> 00:39.930
land the function.

00:40.050 --> 00:48.750
We have a proper Java 8 runtime we have the proper handler for our method and we have everything in

00:48.750 --> 00:53.990
place regarding execution roll and the memory and the timeout.

00:54.090 --> 00:59.560
So we're basically deployed our Java lambda function to A W-S.

00:59.730 --> 01:06.320
So to invoke these functions and work on these with versions aliases and much more.

01:06.540 --> 01:07.950
I'll see on the next section.
